A python interface for training Reinforcement Learning bots to battle on [pokemon showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/).

This project aims at providing a Python environment for interacting in [pokemon showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/) battles, with reinforcement learning in mind.

## Installation

This project uses python 3.7.4. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Acknowledgements

This project is a follow-up of a group project from an artifical intelligence class at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/). You can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/hsahovic/inf581-project). It is partially inspired by the [showdown-battle-bot project](https://github.com/Synedh/showdown-battle-bot). Of course, none of these would have been possible without [Pokemon Showdown](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown).
